# Wireframe Project

This programm takes a filepath as argument which contains data stored with this pattern :

1,2,3,5,7,4,
0,3,5,7,2,0,
2,5,3,7,5,8

Once loaded the programm will display a 3D representation of the Wireframe taking these values as heights,
lines and colums are the same as in the text file.

Use T to zoom in, and G to zoom out.

Use Y to increased the angle and H to decrease it.

Use X to toggle on and off the grid. (disabled by default)

Use C to toggle the links between points

Use W to toggle the height between the grid and points

Use B to toggle the color fade on the heights

Use the arrow keys to move the camera.
